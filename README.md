# LiveChat3
The original Khan Academy chat client.

**This project has not yet entered production.**

*LiveChat3* is the bookmarklet version of the original *LiveChat*, which was released in the spring of '17. While a stable, production version has not yet been released, here are the main features (upcoming marked with \*):

    - Core functionality, with posts displayed live
    - All the original post features (voting, commenting, editing, etc), updated live
    - Exact time, so you don't get relative 'Posted about a minute ago' timestamps
    - Built-in blacklist to keep posts clean*
    - Emoji support, so that :D displays as ðŸ˜ƒ*
    - LiveChat tab on the comment page, so you can nicely edit your settings, check out the FAQs or stay up-to-date on current features*
    - Image display, so that those screenshots aren't just links*

Whether you're collaborating on a project or just talking with friends, *LiveChat3* will make your chatting experience on KA even better. Why not give it a shot? It's as easy-to-use as clicking a button (literally).
